The course includes units on the math of chemistry, gas laws, matter and energy, atomic and molecular structure, bonding, kinetics, equilibrium, acids and bases, redox and electrochemistry, and organic chemistry. A major emphasis of this course is to discuss chemistry as a science and to help students develop scientific literacy in chemistry. Most importantly, this course will be structured to increase students’ excitement and interest in chemistry. To ensure this, a number of different teaching strategies are employed allowing students to learn by becoming actively involved in the class. In addition, laboratory work is an integral part of this experience.</p> </section> <section class="3u$ 6u(medium) 12u$(xsmall)"> <span class="icon alt major fa-eyedropper"></span> <h3><a>Forensics</a></h3> <p>The basic concept of forensics is Locard’s principle: “every contact leaves a trace”. Using this principle we have looked at the JFK assassination, one of the best researched cases from the point of view of forensics. We also looked at the Shroud of Turin Research Project, this is the most heavily studied artifact in human history. The extent of the forensic research done on the Shroud of Turin is truly astounding and demonstrates the width and breadth of what can be determined from forensics.This semester the students are studying the 911 attack. This provides a lot of engineering forensics and bomb analysis which are two areas of forensics that we did not cover with either JFK or the Shroud of Turin.</p> </section> </div></div>'

						<h3>Living Environment</h3>
						<p>The Living Environment course will prepare students to take the NYS Regents:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Living Environment/Biology examination which will be given in June 2014. The course will cover the main areas of biology and will be accompanied by weekly laboratory investigations.The laboratory investigations and homework will reinforce the concepts learned in class, and will count toward the final grade. Homework will include written answers to textbook questions as well as supplementary handouts.The following outline lists the main topics that will be covered during class lectures, laboratory investigations, discussions as well as the result of viewing videos, using computer software and preparing homework assignments.</li>
						</ul>
				
						<h3>Earth Science</h3>
						<p>Regents based physical science course. We cover 10 topics under the umbrella of “Earth Science”. Astronomy, Meteorology, Earth’s processes, Dynamic Earth, Rocks and Minerals, Geologic History, Environmental pollution, Maps, and Graphs are the major topics.</p>
						
						<h3>Chemistry</h3>
						<p>Chemistry is the study of matter, the elements that compose it, and all of the reactions it can undergo. The course includes units on the math of chemistry, gas laws, matter and energy, atomic and molecular structure, bonding, kinetics, equilibrium, acids and bases, redox and electrochemistry, and organic chemistry. A major emphasis of this course is to discuss chemistry as a science and to help students develop scientific literacy in chemistry. Most importantly, this course will be structured to increase students’ excitement and interest in chemistry. To ensure this, a number of different teaching strategies are employed allowing students to learn by becoming actively involved in the class. In addition, laboratory work is an integral part of this experience. The course is taught following the New York State Regents curriculum as well as the Common Core Learning Standards; it is intended that all students will take the Regents Exam in June.As previously mentioned, labs are an essential aspect of the learning process associated with Regents Chemistry. Moreover, labs should be considered as an effort to apply what is taught in the classroom to real world scenarios. In accordance to New York State Department of Education regulations, students enrolled in Regents Chemistry are required to have at least 1200 minutes of laboratory experience to be eligible to take the Regents Chemistry examination at the end of June; therefore, students who do not meet this requirement will be ineligible to take the examination. This year’s lab experience will provide students with approximately 1500-1800 laboratory minutes to offer more opportunities to fulfill the lab minute requirement. Each student will be provided with the specific requirements for writing a formal lab. The formal writing template should be used unless otherwise noted. Failure to comply with these guidelines will result in a reduction of the student’s grade. Lastly, each student will be assigned a lab partner for each grading cycle; however, each group member is responsible to create their own formal lab write up. NO FOOD/DRINK is allowed on your desk or the lab bench. This is for your own safety!</p>

      					<h3>Forensics</h3>
      					<p>The basic concept of forensics is Locard’s principle: “every contact leaves a trace”. Using this principle we have looked at the JFK assassination, one of the best researched cases from the point of view of forensics. We also looked at the Shroud of Turin Research Project, this is the most heavily studied artifact in human history. The extent of the forensic research done on the Shroud of Turin is truly astounding and demonstrates the width and breadth of what can be determined from forensics.This semester the students are studying the 911 attack. This provides a lot of engineering forensics and bomb analysis which are two areas of forensics that we did not cover with either JFK or the Shroud of Turin.</p>
